This is my vim config. It should work the same across most platforms and has
been tested on Linux, Mac OSX, FreeBSD, Windows, and Cygwin.

Install Notes
-------------
* You should really use Vim 7.3, although in theory it should work with any version of Vim 7.
* There are a few niceties (especially for Python dev) assuming you have a Vim with Python support. You can check this with `:python`.
* I compile Vim with the [neato breakindent patch](https://retracile.net/wiki/VimBreakIndent]), but no harm done if you don't have a patched copy of Vim.
